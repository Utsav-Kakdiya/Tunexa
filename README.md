# Tunexa

Tunexa is a music search web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to search for an artist or song name and listen to a 30-second music clip. I created this project to practice and enhance my understanding of APIs in JavaScript. Through this project, I improved my skills in making API requests, handling responses, and dynamically updating the user interface. The interface is clean and user-friendly, making music exploration simple and enjoyable.
